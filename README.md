Our project explored how CLIP represents perceptually ambiguous images, through the popular duck-rabbit optical illusion, in its embedding space. Using images of rabbits and ducks, we tested similarity scores of the base image of the illusion along with testing potential sources of bias in CLIP's interpretation by manipulating the illusion image through spatial realignment, feature cropping, rotation and colorization.

The results revealed that the illusion was positioned between strictly duck and strictly rabbit with similarity scores of rabbit: 0.2822 and duck: 0.2607. This confirmed that CLIP encodes perceptual ambiguity. Moreover, we found that geometric manipulations (specifically rotation) biased CLIP's interpretation more than color manipulations, suggesting a prioritization of shape/structure over color.
